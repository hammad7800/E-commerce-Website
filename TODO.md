# TODO: Add Slide Transitions to Cards on Home Page

- [x] Update JavaScript in home.html to apply 'slide-in' class to cards instead of 'fade-in'
- [x] Adjust slide-in animation in style.css to slide from left with opacity fade-in and add staggered delays
- [x] Test the slide effect by refreshing the page
